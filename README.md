## Overview

This repository contains the full MATLAB analysis pipeline for the **Gimbal Experiment**, designed to study **maximum voluntary force (MVF)** and **force coordination** under different arm configurations and task conditions.  
The script reproduces all figures and statistics reported in the related manuscript (Figs. 7–10 and Supplementary Figs. 12–20).

The analysis is fully automated: simply run the main `.m` file to import, process, and visualize data for all subjects.  
All the required data are already included in this repository.

## What the Script Does

The script executes the following stages:

1. **Setup and Formatting**  
   Sets MATLAB’s figure, font, and interpreter defaults for publication-quality plots.

2. **Data Loading**  
   - Imports per-subject MVF data (`S#_MVF_i.txt`, `S#_MVF_f.txt`)  
   - Imports all trial data for both conditions (`CN`, `UCN`) and all tasks (`FLAT`, `LCK`, `FEX`, `FEXURD`, `ULCK`)  
   - Automatically trims the last 3 s of each trial for steady-state analysis  

3. **Computation of Force Metrics**  
   - Calculates instantaneous and median total force magnitude ‖F‖  
   - Computes per-trial, per-subject, and pooled values across repetitions  

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Performs 2-way ANOVA (Condition × Task) per subject with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests  
   - Computes Cohen’s *d* effect sizes for relevant comparisons  
   - Conducts paired *t*-tests between Pre- and Post-MVF conditions  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Single-Subject Analysis (Figs. 7, S12–S20): time-series plots for total and component forces (Fx, Fy, Fz)  
   - Per-Subject Boxplots (Fig. 8): distributions across tasks and conditions  
   - Histogram Summaries (Fig. 9): median differences between configurations  
   - Pre vs Post Comparisons (Fig. 10): boxplots aligned by subject with significance reporting

## Input File Naming Convention

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| MVF (Initial) | `S1_MVF_i.txt` | Pre-experiment maximum voluntary force |
| MVF (Final) | `S1_MVF_f.txt` | Post-experiment maximum voluntary force |
| Trial | `S1_CN_LCK_T3.txt` | Subject 1, Condition CN (Undesired), Task LCK, Trial 3 |

Each file must contain **time-series data** with at least the first three columns being **Fx, Fy, Fz [N]**.

## Key Variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|
| `condition` | `{'CN','UCN'}` — Undesired / Preferred arm configurations |
| `task` | `{'FLAT','LCK','FEX','FEXURD','ULCK'}` |
| `fs` | Sampling frequency (default 50 Hz) |
| `idx_min`, `idx_max` | Index range used for 3 s steady-state window |
| `MVF_tot_i`, `MVF_tot_f` | Subject-level MVF stats (mean / std of ‖F‖) |
| `f_tot_med` | Median force magnitude per trial |
| `medianCondDiff` | CN − UCN difference in median force |
| `T_summary` | Table summarizing Pre / Post MVF results |

---

## Output and Figures

When run, the script automatically generates:

- Per-Subject Figures – time-series plots (Undesired vs Preferred)  
- Boxplots – task-wise distributions across conditions  
- Histograms – median differences in absolute / percentage terms  
- Summary Table – Pre vs Post MVF differences with *t*-test p-values  
- ANOVA Post-hoc Tables – stored as variables (`resultsTable{subj}`) with effect sizes  

---

## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2022a or newer  
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for `anovan`, `multcompare`, `ttest2`)  
- No particular hardware required  
- Tested configuration: Windows 11, Intel i7 11th Gen CPU, 16 GB RAM

## Performance and Setup

| Parameter | Detail |
|------------|---------|
| Typical running time | ~120 seconds (≈ 2 minutes) |
| Installation time | None (after MATLAB is running) |
| Hardware requirements | None beyond a standard laptop/desktop |
| Operating system tested | Windows 11 |
| Data availability | All data files included in `Data/` |

## How to Run

1. Ensure MATLAB is installed and running.  
2. Place all data files inside a folder named `Data` in the same directory as the script.  
3. Open `ForceAnalysis_Gimbal.m` in MATLAB.  
4. Press **Run**, or execute:

```matlab
run('ForceAnalysis_Gimbal.m')
